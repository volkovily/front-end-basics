            A banana is an elongated, edible fruit - botanically a berry - produced by several kinds of 
            large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", 
            distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved,
            with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe.

            Bananas are one of the most widely consumed fruits in the world for good reason. 
            They are a rich source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber, and are known to be good for heart health. 
            Bananas are also a great snack for athletes and active individuals, as they provide a quick source of energy and help 
            to prevent muscle cramps. In addition to being a healthy food choice, bananas are also delicious and versatile, and 
            can be used in a variety of recipes, from smoothies and baked goods to savory dishes like curries and stews. 
            Bananas are also known to be good for heart health. They are rich in potassium, which helps to regulate blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease.
